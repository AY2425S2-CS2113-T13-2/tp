## Overview
PayPals is a CLI-based application that aims to simplify payments by minimising the number of transactions needed to balance shared expenses.

## Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature: Implemented Help Command**
    * **What it does**: Enhanced the Help command to provide detailed usage instructions and improved overall formatting.
    * **Justification**: A clear Help command reduces the learning curve for users and minimizes common input errors.
    * **Highlights**: The updated Help command now includes comprehensive examples and guidance on using all available commands.


* **New Feature: List Balance Functionality**
    * **What it does**: Implemented the `list balance n/NAME` command to display a user's net balance, summarising all unpaid transactions into a single positive or negative amount.
    * **Justification**: This feature provides users with a quick snapshot of their financial standing within a group, helping them manage expenses efficiently.
    * **Highlights**: Robust balance calculation logic that accounts for both amounts owed to and by the user.


* **General Code Contributions: Abstraction, Refactoring, and Logging**
    * **What it does**: Centralised command implementation by having all command types inherit from a base abstract class, standardized exception handling through enumerated messages, and encapsulated logging logic for consistency.
    * **Justification**: This abstraction improves code structure and maintainability by hiding complex details behind simple interfaces, making it easier for developers to work on high-level concepts.
    * **Highlights**: Enhanced error reporting and graceful recovery, leading to a more robust codebase.


* **UI Class Enhancements**
    * **What it does**: Refined the UI class to standardise output formatting and ensure consistent display across commands.
    * **Justification**: A consistent, clear UI improves the overall user experience, particularly in a CLI application.
    * **Highlights**: Updated display formats for command responses and enhanced error messaging.


* **Code Documentation Enhancements**
    * **What it does**: I added comprehensive Javadoc comments to key classes (e.g., `AddCommand`, `HelpCommand`, `EditCommand`) to improve code readability and maintainability.
    * **Justification**: Clear documentation is vital for long-term maintenance and for new developers to quickly understand the codebase.
    * **Highlights**: Streamlined and standardized documentation across the project, facilitating debugging and future feature enhancements.

* **User Guide Improvements**
    * **What it does**: Revised all command examples to reflect clearer outputs, added a detailed Help section, included a Glossary to define key terms, and incorporated Command Tips to assist users.
    * **Justification**: Enhancing the User Guide ensures that new users can quickly understand and effectively use the application.
    * **Highlights**: Added the new `list balance` information and improved troubleshooting guidance for command mistakes.

* **Developer Guide Enhancements**
    * **What it does**: Added sequence diagrams that illustrate interactions among key components (commands, storage, UI, etc.) and a class diagram for the activity component (showing interactions between `Activity`, `ActivityManager`, `Person`, and `Logging`).
    * **Justification**: Detailed diagrams provide clarity on system architecture, making it easier for future development and maintenance.
    * **Highlights**: Comprehensive coverage of the activity component section and clear documentation of internal workflows.

* **Project Management & Community Contributions**
    * Participated actively in code reviews and provided constructive feedback.
    * Assisted in updating both the User Guide and Developer Guide.
    * Engaged in forum discussions to help resolve bugs and improve project features.
